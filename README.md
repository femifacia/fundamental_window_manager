# fundamental_window_manager

A project of window manager with all fundamental functionalities

I am still developping this so I will add the proper documentation when I will add the last functionalities

Thanks to [jichu4n](https://github.com/jichu4n) and its [window manager repo](https://github.com/jichu4n/basic_wm).

I reversed its code to create the skeleton of my Window Manager.
